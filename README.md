# Mini Movie Catalog App

- React react-router-dom Practice Project

As part of Meta's Front End Developer Certificate program offered by Coursera, in the React Basics course they had a lesson on Navigation using the react-router-dom. I asked Bing to give me a practice project to help me understand and implement the router function better. This is what it gave me.

## Project Name

**Mini Movie Catalog App**

## Project Description

You are going to create a simple website that displays a list of movies and their details. The website will have a navigation menu with links to different genres, such as action, comedy, drama, etc. When the user clicks on a link, the website will show a list of movies from that genre, stored in a local array. The user can also click on a movie title to see more details about that movie, such as the release year, director, cast, plot, etc.

## Thoughts Going In

As this website is going to be based on a catalog created in a local array, it's not going to be expansive. I'm thinking of maybe making it based exclusively on Marvel Cinematic Universe movies and possibly streaming shows, if I can figure out at least, say, four categories that can each have two or more shows per.

## Lessons Learned

TBD

## Diary

2023-11-15 Need to figure out categories, movies, and relevant details for the array.
